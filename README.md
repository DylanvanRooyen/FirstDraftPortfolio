# FirstDraftPortfolio
Started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on JetBrains Academy and LinkedIn Learning. This is what I have created so far.

Youll find my HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in Portfolio > task > src.
The task was to create a basic portfolio in 5 stages, and add the HTML, CSS and JavaScript as we learnt it. 
It might not be the most tidy code as for for that reason.
My JavaScript functions are to enable the flash card to popUp as well as to make the burger tool be used like a button to make the index table appear and disappear.
There is also some CSS and JavaScript that enables the burger icon to change into a cross when pressed.
